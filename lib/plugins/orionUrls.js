 * Operation identification table. Each row of the table contains a Context Broker operation with three fields:
 * the method of the operation, a regular expression to identify the URL, and the action that operation should be
 * assigned.
 *
 * The fourth field (which is optional) is used to match with the URL query parameters of the operation. Note that
 * if two rows are equal in method and URL one with query parameters and the other without them, then the row
 * with the query parameters must be *before* in the table (otherwise the checking in orionPlugin which uses
