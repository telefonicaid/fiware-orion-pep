Feature: Context broker actions when the role is defined only in a project
  Check if all urls of CB are mapped to the correct action. This action are defined in the project of the user in Keystone

  Background:
    Given the Context Broker configuration

  #Standard operations
  Scenario Outline: Create Standard operation
